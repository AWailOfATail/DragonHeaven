Showdown Boilerplate
========================================================================

Showdown Boilerplate is a template for private servers of [Pokémon Showdown][1]. Pokémon Showdown is created [Zarel][2].

What is a boilerplate? Boilerplate is any text that is or can be reused in new contexts or applications without being greatly changed from the original.

This repository contains the files needed to set up your own Pokémon Showdown server with all the amazing stuff that Pokémon Showdown private servers like Frost and Pandora has. This also includes [Pokemon-Showdown-Addons][3] created by [kota][4].
